## Introduction

Accessibility is incredibly important, yet often overlooked in traditional
digital design and development education. Because of this, the **a11y** Project strives to be a living example of how to create beautiful, accessible, and inclusive digital experiences.

## Disability

One in four people in the United States has a disability. For many, technology
built with accessibility in mind makes things easier. For people with
disabilities, technology makes things possible.

Websites and apps can be made to work in such a way that it can be understood by
assistive technology such as screen readers, refreshable braille displays, and
screen magnifiers. Many disabled people rely on such devices to do things like
order food, pay taxes, apply to jobs, and talk with their friends and family.

Additionally, websites and web apps can be designed to be understood by the
widest possible audience. This includes accommodating things like
colorblindness, Dylexia and Dyscalculia, seizure and migraine triggers, as well
as reading comprehension level and cognitive load.

## Inclusion

> Accessibility is important. Inclusion is essential.

Without representation, it is impossible to understand, much less effectively
make accessible digital experiences.

In addition, accessibility work is oftentimes done after the fact to great
expense. Inclusivity asks people making digital experiences to consider early
and often what barriers and biases might keep people from being present, and
what they can do about it.

## Opportunity

Making things accessible translates to better opportunities, as it means more
people can use them. Accessible digital experiences also remove barriers. This
is incredibly important for things like employment, an area where disabled
people have been historically faced discrimination.

In addition, recent research (PDF) has revealed that there are billions of
dollars in potential revenue if accessibility needs are accommodated. For
example, the keyboard present with every desktop and laptop computer, tablet,
and smartphone are derived from the Hansen Writing Ball, assistive technology
invented in the early 1800s.

## What does the term **a11y** mean?

“**A11y**” stands for “accessibility.” It is a numeronym, with 11 representing the
count of letters between the letter a and the letter y. Other numeronyms you may
be familiar with include: i18n (internationalization), P2P (peer to peer), WWII
(World War 2), etc.

The word accessibility has different meanings in different contexts. On the
internet, the use of the term **a11y** helps to identify content related
specifically to digital accessibility. For example, it is often used as a
Twitter hashtag by digital accessibility practitioners.
